# Research & Development Archive

This directory contains historical versions and research artifacts of the ThreadGuard static analyzer.

## Directory Structure

- `threadguard/` - Versioned snapshots of the ThreadGuard analyzer
  - `v1/` - Initial research versions
    - `threadguard_new.py` - Early development version
    - `threadguard_fixes.py` - Experimental fixes and enhancements
  - `v2/` - Future versions and experiments

## Purpose

This directory serves as a reference for:
- Historical tracking of development
- Research experiments
- Performance comparisons
- Reference implementations

## Usage

These files are not meant for production use. The current production version is in the root directory as `threadguard_enhanced.py`.

## Contributing

When creating new research versions:
1. Create a new versioned directory (e.g., `v3/`)
2. Document the purpose and changes in this README
3. Include any test files or documentation specific to that version

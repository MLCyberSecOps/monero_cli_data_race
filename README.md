ThreadGuard is an advanced static analysis tool designed to detect concurrency issues in C++ codebases. Initially developed to analyze the Monero CLI wallet, it has evolved into a comprehensive solution for identifying thread safety violations, data races, and synchronization bugs in multithreaded applications.

## üîÑ Version 2.0.0 Changelog (2024-06-23)

### üöÄ New Features
- **Enhanced Deadlock Detection**: Improved algorithms for detecting potential deadlocks and lock ordering issues
- **Mutex Checker Tool**: Added `simple_mutex_checker.py` for quick analysis of mutex usage patterns
- **Monero Analysis Scripts**: Specialized scripts for analyzing Monero's codebase
- **Performance Optimizations**: Faster analysis through optimized pattern matching

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed false positives in lock acquisition order analysis
- Improved handling of RAII lock guards
- Better detection of recursive locking patterns

### üì¶ Dependencies
- Updated to support Python 3.7+
- Added new dependencies for enhanced analysis

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Race Detection**: Identify unsynchronized access to shared variables across threads
- **Thread Safety Analysis**: Detect potential thread safety violations in critical sections
- **Advanced Locking Analysis**: 
  - Verify proper mutex locking/unlocking patterns
  - Detect recursive locking
  - Identify potential deadlocks and lock ordering issues
- **Monero-Specific Analysis**: Specialized detection for common concurrency patterns in Monero's codebase
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports in multiple formats (JSON, console)

## Research Purpose

This tool is developed for education and research purposes to analyze potential concurrency issues. It does not contain any exploits. The analysis is not intended for publication.
